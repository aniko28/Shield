    <h5>A LITTLE ABOUT OUR AGENCY</h5>

<div class="container2">

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
            <p>We believe ideas come from everyone, everywhere. In fact, at BlackTie, everyone within our agency walls
                is a
                designer in their own right. And there are a few principles we believe—and we believe everyone should
                believe—about our design craft. These truths drive us, motivate us, and ultimately help us redefine the
                power of design. We’re big believers in doing right by our neighbors. After all, we grew up in the Twin
                Cities and we believe this place has much to offer. So we do what we can to support the community we
                love.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
            <p>Over the past four years, we’ve provided more than $1 million in combined cash and pro bono support to
                Way to
                Grow, an early childhood education and nonprofit organization. Other community giving involvement
                throughout
                our agency history includes pro bono work for more than 13 organizations, direct giving, a scholarship
                program through the Minneapolis College of Art & Design, board memberships, and ongoing participation in
                the
                Keystone Club, which gives five percent of our company’s earnings back to the community each year.</p>

    <h6>DESIGN EXPAND BOUNDARIES</h6>
    <p>To achieve real change, we have to expand boundaries. Because the Wild West of what-could-be is unexplored but

    <h5>ONE BRAND, ONE VOICE.</h5>
</div>
<div class="pool1">
    <p>Employees and consumers. Two halves of a brand’s entirety, the whole of a brand’s audience. Sometimes these two
        halves have very different viewpoints, creating a weak spot in the brand story. Weakness tarnishes credibility.
        Brands that aren’t credible aren’t viable.</p></div>
<div class="pool2">
    <p>We squash weakness by designing the whole brand story. It’s crafted around the truism held by employees and
        consumers to create an experience that connects from the inside out.</p></div>
<div class="pool3">
    <p>By being true to the brand we represent, we elevate the audiences’ relationship to it. Like becomes love becomes
        a passion. Passion becomes advocacy. And we see the brand blossom from within, creating a whole story the
        audience embraces. That’s when the brand can truly flex its muscles.</p></div>
